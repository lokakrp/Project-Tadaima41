<h2>Tadaima41:</h2>

<p><strong>I decided to create a program that does many things:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Takes input of any Instagram username entered</li>
  <li>Logs into my Instagram account</li>
  <li>Web scrapes Instagram Reel links from the profiles</li>
  <li>Downloads the videos</li>
  <li>Edits the videos to include my custom video below</li>
  <li>Loops or cuts the main video to match the custom video</li>
  <li>Logs back into my Instagram and uploads the video</li>
  <li>Adds a custom caption from my list of 150+ AI-generated captions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Have I Created This?</h2>

<p>Many Instagram accounts post content that is purely meaningless and mind-numbing, commonly referred to as "brainrot." These posts often feature random or nonsensical videos paired with unrelated clips below, bombarding the brain with multiple forms of media at once. This overwhelming exposure, especially with short-form media that encourages constant scrolling, leads to reduced attention spans.</p>

<p>I also created this project out of boredom, thinking it would be a fun challenge with interesting results.<br>
