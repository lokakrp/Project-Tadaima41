###

<p align="left">I decided to create a program that does many things:<br>• Takes input of any instagram name entered<br>• Logs into my Instagram<br>• Webscrapes Instagram reel links from the profiles<br>• Downloads the video<br>• Edits the video to include my custom video below<br>• Loops/Cuts main video to match custom video<br>• Logs into my instagram and uploads the video<br>• Adds my custom caption list of 150+ captions made with custom AI</p>

<h2 align="left">Why Have I created this?</h2>

###

<p align="left">Many Instagram accounts post content that is purely meaningless and mind-numbing, commonly referred to as "brainrot." These posts often feature a random or nonsensical video paired with an unrelated clip below, exposing the brain to multiple pieces of media simultaneously. This overwhelms the brain with content, especially since it’s short-form media that users constantly scroll through, leading to reduced attention spans.</p>

<p align="left">I also decided to make one purely out of boredom and because I thought it would be a fun project with fun results.<br>You can check out the Instagram page below!</p>
